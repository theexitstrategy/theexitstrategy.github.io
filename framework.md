title: Framework for the fabrication of complex geometries.
---

In order to accomplish the goal of creating homogeneous conditions for complex geometries, the underlying relationships of the complex manufacturing process have to be understood. Powder-bed based additive manufacturing is a complex process governed by different physical interactions. A high-energy electron beam is used to selectively consolidate powder particles within a defined contour to create a solid material layer of the final part. The interaction between the electron beam and the powder particles determine the energy absorption and the formation of a liquid melt pool. 

The central idea of this project is the utilization of the relationship between the melt pool and the emerging material properties:

* The consolidation of powder to form a dense layer is determined by the local melt pool geometry. If the melt pool depth is not sufficient, the powder layer is not sufficiently molten and the new layer is not able connect to the previous layer.
* The properties of the phase transformation from the liquid melt pool to the solid part (solidification) determine the final microstructure of the part, which in turn are responsible for the mechanical properties.
