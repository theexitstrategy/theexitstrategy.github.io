title: Framework for the fabrication of complex geometries with desired properties in electron beam powder bed fusion
---

For the proper motivation of such a topic an appropriate framing is necessary.
Powder bed based additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of arbitrary complex geometries by selectively consolidation of powder in the cross section of the final geometry. In order to consolidate the powder into a dense slice of the finale component, different strategies exist in order to consolidate the powder at each position. One possibility to fill the contour is the **hatch** where the beam moves along a dedicated path within the cross section of the layer.
