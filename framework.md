title: Framework for the fabrication of complex geometries with desired properties in electron beam powder bed fusion
---

For the proper motivation of such a topic an appropriate framing is necessary.
Powder bed based additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of arbitrary complex geometries by selectively consolidation of powder in the cross section of the final geometry. In order to consolidate the powder into a dense slice of the finale component, different strategies exist in order to consolidate the powder at each position. One possibility to fill the contour is the **hatch** where the beam moves along a dedicated path within the cross section of the layer.

The core idea of this project is the relationship between the thermal field / melt pool and the resulting properties of the part.

-	In a simplified way, the consolidation of powder to form a dense layer is determined by the melt pool geometry. If the melt pool depth is insufficient, not the complete powder layer is consolidated and the new layer is not able to connect to the previous layer and connection faults, which are a typical defect in additive manufacturing, occur.
-	The properties of the phase transformation from the liquid melt pool back towards a solid part (solidification) are an indicator for the final microstructure of the part.
