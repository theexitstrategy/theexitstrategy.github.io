title: Notes on Optimization
---

Optimization can be understood as the minization of an arbitrary function. To apply this methodology onto the problem at hand, the problem has to be converted into a  function that represents the problem.

-	What is the optimal objective function that represents the quasi-stationary state of the hatch? Does a constant value fit the description of the quasi-stationary state, or does the function need to be adapted?
- How does the appropriate transition function from molten to powder areas at the boundary of the hatch need to be desinged? Is a discrete transition sufficent, or does a continous smooth transition function better represent the actual physics (Gaussian Beam)

Do the above points play a role for the minimization itself, or do they only shift the achieveable functions values towards higher values? Does a better representation of the problem lead to faster convergence of the optimization algorithm?
