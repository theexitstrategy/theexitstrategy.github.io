The goal is to determine hatching strategies and the final vectors using *Prometheus* and transfering the calculated hatches to the native machine format using appropriate interface modules.

  	<figcaption><b>Figure 1.</b> Overview of the process preparation steps: (1) Selection and addition of CAD models representing the build as either support or part; (2) Slicing of each CAD model according to a global layer sequence; (3) Hatching of the respective cross sections of each global layer; (4) Transfer of the hatch vectors with the help of appropriate interface modules to the native machine or simulation format.
