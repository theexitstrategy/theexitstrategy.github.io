Data representations in two dimensions often also require the encoding in two dimensions. One example in the case of additive manufacturing are the solidification conditions ([Solidification Velocity]() & [Solidification Graident]()) that have to either mapped at each coordinate of the meltpool or vice versa. In this case the only option is to encode the location `(x, y)` into one single color to display in the GV diagram.
