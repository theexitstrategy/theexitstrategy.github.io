The combination of two concepts lead to the creation of this blog.

- Various examples show how writing is detrimental for [better thinking and researching](http://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog/).
- Any researcher has to [keep oneself accountable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_Game_(book)) for each decision and action. 

Therefore as with any aspiring project it has to be initialized with enough momentum to continue. For this special purpose, and to keep the momentum high enough to continue, the first subproject was the creation of the beautiful header image.

Geometric forms underlying chaos are called *strange* or *chaotic* attractors. An attractor is what the behavior of a system settles down to, or is attracted to. When $t \rightarrow \infty$ the system reaches the position of the attractor and the equilibrium of the system is established. In case the of **Peter de Jong Attractors**, that underly the image the following equations govern the evolution of the system.

$$
x_{n+1} = sin(a\cdot y_{n}) -cos(b\cdot x_{n}) \\
y_{n+1} = sin(c\cdot x_{n}) -cos(d\cdot y_{n})
$$
