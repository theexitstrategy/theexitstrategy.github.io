This is the website of **Christoph Breuning**. The goal of this page is to be an [Index](https://clearerthinkingpodcast.com/?ep=039) of  [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) that are updated frequently to close the information gap between the [map and the territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation) and result in an better representation of reality.

I am currently working on powder-bed based [additive manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing), specializing in electron beam based additive manufacturing (**E-PBF**). My goal is to establish a [framework](https://theexitstrategy.github.io/framework) for the fabrication of complex geometries with desired properties. An intuition of the underlying principles governing the process and the relationship between different process parameters and the emerging meltpool has to be developed in order to control the process to ones desires.

Further topics to consider working on (that require more though):

- [Thermal stress](https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.762.224) in complex geometries as a result of meltpool geometry & solidification conditions.
- Including the effect of preheating, especially for more geometries in the build chamber, on the melt pool formation. Add additional heating steps to reach a constant temperature prior for each geometry in the build.
- Spot Melting as alternative melting strategy to reach geometry independent properties and also extend the space of possible reachable microstructures. The goal of the spot melt strategy should be the independence of each single spot from all other spots to reach high solidification velocities and keeping a constant melt pool geometry of each spot. First calculations show that the cooling rates are at least one order of magnitude higher compared to the line strategy. Even higher if compared with persistent meltpool which have a generally lower cooling rate.
- Overhang Areas with different material properties of the powder compared to the bulk material. Find an effective thermal diffusivity for subsequent layers with already a number of consolidated layers.
- Adaption of the semi-analytical heat conduction model for different power density distributions ([Top-Hat](https://www.edmundoptics.eu/contentassets/a22cc770fce541438bb18385a20ebb07/why-use-a-flat-top-laser-beam-fig-1.png)) to achieve the same calculation speed for other important processes.

Apart from additive manufacutring i am also intrested in several other topics:
