This is the website of **Christoph Breuning**.

The goal of this page is to function as an [Index](https://clearerthinkingpodcast.com/?ep=039) of [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) that are updated frequently to close the information gap between the [map and the territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation) and result in an better representation of reality.

## Projects
I am currently working on powder-bed based [additive manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing) focusing on electron beam based additive manufacutring. The objective is to establish a [framework](https://theexitstrategy.github.io/framework) for the fabrication of complex geometries with desired proteries. To tame the complex interactions in the process, an intuition of the the underlying principles and the relationship between different process parameters and the emerging meltpool has to be developed.

## Further Topics (that require more thought):
-	Computation of [Thermal stresses](https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.762.224) in complex geometries as a result of the emerging meltpool geometry.
-	Influence of [Overhang Areas](https://theexitstrategy.github.io/overhang) on the emerging meltpool geometry and solidification conditions. The goal is to find an effective thermal diffusivity for melting diretly into the power and subsequent alyers to compute optimal processing parameters.
- Adaption of the semi-analytical heat conduction model for different power density distributions ([Top-Hat](https://www.edmundoptics.eu/contentassets/a22cc770fce541438bb18385a20ebb07/why-use-a-flat-top-laser-beam-fig-1.png)) to achieve the same calculation speed for other important processes. This process should be able to be adapted similar to the calculation of a pseudo-gaussian distribution from [segmental ring heat sources](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11663-000-0022-2.pdf). Except in this case the power distribution has to be integrated over the top hat profile instead.
- Including the effect of preheating, especially for more geometries in the build chamber, on the melt pool formation. Add additional heating steps to reach a constant temperature prior for each geometry in the build.
- Spot Melting as alternative melting strategy to reach geometry independent properties and also extend the space of possible reachable microstructures. The goal of the spot melt strategy should be the independence of each single spot from all other spots to reach high solidification velocities and keeping a constant melt pool geometry of each spot. First calculations show that the cooling rates are at least one order of magnitude higher compared to the line strategy. Even higher if compared with persistent meltpool which have a generally lower cooling rate.
