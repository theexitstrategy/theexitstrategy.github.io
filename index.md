This is the Website of **Christoph Breuning**. The Objective of this page is to function as sort of home for [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) that should be updated frequently like the priors of [Bayesian Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization).

        <span class='caption-label'>Figure 1.</span> Diagram of rejection sampling. The 
        density $q(\mathbf{z})$ must be always greater than $p(\mathbf{x})$. A new sample 
        is rejected if it falls in the gray region and accepted otherwise. These accepted 
        samples are distributed according to $p(\mathbf{x})$. This is achieved by sampling 
        $z_i$ from $q(\mathbf{z})$, and then sampling uniformly from $[0, k q(z_i)]$. 
        Samples under the curve $p(z_i)$ are accepted.
