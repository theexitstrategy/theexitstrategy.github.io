This is the website of **Christoph Breuning**. The goal of this page is to be an [Index](https://clearerthinkingpodcast.com/?ep=039) of  [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) that are updated frequently to close the information gap between the [map and the territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation) and result in an better representation of reality.

I am currently working on powder-bed based [additive manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing), specializing in electron beam based additive manufacturing (**E-PBF**). My goal is to establish a [framework](https://theexitstrategy.github.io/framework) for the fabrication of complex geometries with desired properties. An intuition of the underlying principles governing the process and the relationship between different process parameters and the emerging meltpool has to be developed in order to control the process to ones desires.
